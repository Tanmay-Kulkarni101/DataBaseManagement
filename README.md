# Database Systems Lab Material
This repository includes everything that was taught in the lab for the Database Course during the spring session of 2017-18 at BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus

There are 11 folders corresponding to each lab. It covers excercises starting from labelling creating your own tables and simple queries to programmable sql.

There is nothing to build or install in this code. It consists of commands and their corresponding explanations. This code was run on SQL Server.

If you have any doubts or wish to add a pull request to help the code stay on par with the latest excercises feel free to send a pull request.
