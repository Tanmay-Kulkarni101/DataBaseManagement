Altering the properties of Tables
create table course(cid int,cname varchar(10));
//In oracle sql it is not mandatory to create the primary key. However, this varies from vendor to vendor.

alter table course add constraint c_pk primary key (cid);
//c_pk is the name of the contraint that we have applied. We can drop the constraint by refering to the same variable name.

insert into course values(101,'Physics');
insert into course values(101,'Chemistry');
//This leads to the message
//ORA-00001: unique constraint (TANMAY.C_PK) violated

alter table course add credits int;
//Adda a new column credits

alter table course drop column credits;
//Drops the column credits

alter table course drop column cid;
//Generally this must fail as it is the primary key.

 drop table course;
 //Drops the table

 create table state(stname varchar(20) primary key,pop int, capital varchar(20),cm varchar(10));

create table cm(name varchar(10) primary key,age int,state varchar(20));
//Here we wish to create a circular dependency in which both tables have a foreign key pointing at one another.
//For this reason we first individually define both and then attach the keys separately

alter table state add constraint st_fk foreign key(cm) references cm(name);
//Thus, the cm acts like a foreign key which referneces to the name of cm

alter table cm add constraint cm_fk foreign key(state) references state(stname);
//This adds a foreign key referencing to the name of the state in the state table.
