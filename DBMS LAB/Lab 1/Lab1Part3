string should be in single quotes
varchar adjusts to the required size
char only always allocates a constant size
we can have only one primary key,we declare it by either specifying it after the column or after all the columns by enclosing the required column in brackets.
we can make an attribute say aadhar as unique, by using the unique keyword
use the not null if we do not wish to have null values
